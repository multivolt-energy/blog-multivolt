# Off Grid Solar System

**Off-Grid Solar System**: Operates independently from the utility grid. It requires batteries to store energy and continues to work during power outages.

## How it Works:
1. **Solar Panels**: Capture sunlight to generate electricity.
2. **Charge Controller**: Regulates the energy stored in batteries.
3. **Battery Bank**: Stores excess energy for use when sunlight is unavailable.
4. **Inverter**: Converts stored DC energy from the batteries into usable AC electricity.
5. **Usage**: Power is supplied to appliances and devices, even when there's no grid power.

# On Grid Solar System

**On-Grid Solar System**: Connected to the utility grid. Excess electricity generated by the solar panels is sent back to the grid, but there is no backup during power outages.

## How it Works:
1. **Solar Panels**: Generate electricity from sunlight.
2. **Inverter**: Converts DC electricity to AC for use in your home.
3. **Grid Connection**: Excess electricity is exported to the utility grid, and you can use grid power when needed.
4. **Net Metering**: The system tracks how much electricity is sent to the grid, and you receive credits on your bill.

### In summary

- Off-grid systems provide independence and backup power but require battery storage.  
- On-grid systems rely on the utility grid and do not function during outages unless combined with batteries.
